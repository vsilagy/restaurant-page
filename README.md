### **The Odin Project**: [Restaurant Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)

#### Objectives:

- Set up an HTML skeleton inside of `dist/index.html` with single `<div id="content">`
- create HTML elements by using JavaScript only inside `src/index.js` , e.g. by appending each new element to div#content once the page is first loaded.
- Set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu page
